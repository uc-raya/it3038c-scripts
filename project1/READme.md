For my project I chose to write a script that creates a calculator for users to input values and run mathematical operations.

To run this program, make sure that Python3 is installed and working.

Then, from the it3038c-scripts directory, run the program using Python:
Python project1/calculator.py

You will first be promped to select which mathematical operation you would like to use (*, +, -, /)

Once you select an operation, you'll then be prompted to input any number you'd like and then prompted once more for a second number.

Your output will be the answer of the equation you wrote. An example output would be:
1 - 1 = 
0

The calculator will then ask you if you would like to perform another mathematical operation.
You can either decline by inserting a "n" or "N" or you can continue by inserting a "y" or "Y"
