For my project I chose to write a script that lets users play a game that involves using the keyboard to move a snake around and eat as many meals as possible to achieve a high score.

To run this program, make sure that Python3 is installed and working.

Then, from the it3038c-scripts directory, run the program using Python: Python project2/snakegame.py

The game will open up a purple screen that features the snake (the black square), food (the orange turtle) and the user's score and high score at the top of the screen.

To play the game, the user must move the snake around and hit the turtle and the user will score 2 points for each hit. If the user hits the wall, then they reset back to 0 points.

The snake can move 4 directions:

To move left, the user must hit the "j" key.

To move right, the user must hit the "l" key.

To move up, the user must hit the "i" key.

To move down, the user must hit the "k" key.

The user can play the game as long as they want to achieve a new high score or stop the game any time they want by clicking the "X" in the top right hand corner.
